title: "Gradiant discretization method for the general linear parabolic problem"
subtitle: ""
summary: "Note on the preprint [arXiv:2308.10703: Optimal error estimates for the non-conforming approximations of linear parabolic problems with minimal regularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10703), by J. Droniou, R. Eymard, T. GallouÃ«t, C. Guichard and R. Herbin. This article considers a general linear parabolic problem with extended time boundary conditions approximated by the implicit Euler scheme in time and the Gradient Discretization method in space. The main result is an error estimate which has the same order as the sum of the interpolation error and the conformity error without supplementary regularity hypothesis on the solution. The proof relies on an inf-sup inequality in Hilbert space."
